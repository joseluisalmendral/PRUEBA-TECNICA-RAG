Basic Concepts
Action
Actions are a way to send clickable buttons to the user interface. Each action is attached to a 
Message
 and can be used to trigger a python function when the user clicks on it.


​
Create an action


Actions are sent to the UI through messages:


import
 chainlit 
as
 cl




@cl
.
on_chat_start


async
 
def
 
start
(
)
:


    
# Sending an action button within a chatbot message


    actions 
=
 
[


        cl
.
Action
(


            name
=
"action_button"
,


            icon
=
"mouse-pointer-click"
,


            payload
=
{
"value"
:
 
"example_value"
}
,


            label
=
"Click me!"


        
)


    
]




    
await
 cl
.
Message
(
content
=
"Interact with this action button:"
,
 actions
=
actions
)
.
send
(
)




​
Define a Python Callback


To handle the user’s click on the action button, you need to define a callback function with the 
@cl.action_callback
 decorator:


@cl
.
action_callback
(
"action_button"
)


async
 
def
 
on_action
(
action
:
 cl
.
Action
)
:


    
print
(
action
.
payload
)
