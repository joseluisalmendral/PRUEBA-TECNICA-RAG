Data Persistence
Chat History
Chat history allow users to search, browse and resume their past conversations.


If data persistence is enabled but the user is not authenticated, the conversations will be stored but users won’t be able to see the chat history.


You need both data persistence and 
authentication
 configured to enable the chat history.
