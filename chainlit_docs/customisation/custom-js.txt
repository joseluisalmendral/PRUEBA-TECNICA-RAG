Customisation
JS
You can inject a custom JavaScript script into the application by adding the following to your 
config.toml
:


config.toml
[
UI
]


# ...


# This can either be a css file in your `public` dir or a URL


custom_js
 
=
 
'/public/my_js_script.js'




Once the configuration is updated, restart the application. Your custom script will now be loaded.
