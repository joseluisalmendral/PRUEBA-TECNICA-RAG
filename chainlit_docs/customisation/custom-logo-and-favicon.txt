Customisation
Logo and Favicon
You can customize the Chainlit application with your own logo and favicon.


Assets such as favicons and logos are cached by default by your browser. You
might have to clear your browser cache to see the changes.


​
Use your Logo


Chainlit Application offers support for both dark and light modes. To accommodate this, prepare two versions of your logo, named 
logo_dark.png
 and 
logo_light.png
. Place these logos in a 
/public
 folder next to your application. Once you restart the application, your custom logos should be displayed accordingly.
