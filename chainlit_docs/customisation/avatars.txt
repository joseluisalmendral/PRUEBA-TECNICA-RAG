Customisation
Avatars
The default assistant avatar is the favicon of the application. See how to customize the favicon 
here
.


However, you can customize the avatar by placing an image file in the 
/public/avatars
 folder.
The image file should be named after the author of the message. For example, if the author is 
My Assistant
, the avatar should be named 
my_assistant.png
.


public/


└── avatars/


    └── my_assistant.png
