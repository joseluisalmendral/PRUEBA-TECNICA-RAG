Customisation
CSS
Chainlit Application allows for design customization through the use of a custom CSS stylesheet. To enable this, modify your configuration settings in .chainlit/config.toml.


config.toml
[
UI
]


# ...


# This can either be a css file in your `public` dir or a URL


custom_css
 
=
 
'/public/stylesheet.css'




At the moment, we do not provide a detailed guide of all the available css
classes. It is up to you to dig in the Web Inspector and find the css class
you wish to override.


Once the configuration is updated, restart the application. Your custom styling will now be applied.
