Authentication
Header
Header auth is a simple way to authenticate users using a header. It is typically used to delegate authentication to a reverse proxy.


The 
header_auth_callback
 function is called with the headers of the request. It should return a 
User
 object if the user is authenticated, or 
None
 if the user is not authenticated.
The callback function (defined by the user) is responsible for managing the authentication logic.


​
Example


from
 typing 
import
 Optional




import
 chainlit 
as
 cl






@cl
.
header_auth_callback


def
 
header_auth_callback
(
headers
:
 Dict
)
 
-
>
 Optional
[
cl
.
User
]
:


  
# Verify the signature of a token in the header (ex: jwt token)


  
# or check that the value is matching a row from your database


  
if
 headers
.
get
(
"test-header"
)
 
==
 
"test-value"
:


    
return
 cl
.
User
(
identifier
=
"admin"
,
 metadata
=
{
"role"
:
 
"admin"
,
 
"provider"
:
 
"header"
}
)


  
else
:


    
return
 
None




Using this code, you will not be able to access the app unless the header 
test-header
 is set to 
test-value
 when sending any request to the app.
