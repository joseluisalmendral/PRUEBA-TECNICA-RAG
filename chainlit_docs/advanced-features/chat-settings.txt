Advanced Features
Chat Settings
Chat settings are useful to let each user configure their chat experience given a set of options.


​
How it works


Check the chat settings 
API reference
 to learn how to configure it.

Preview


If chat settings are set, a new button will appear in the chat bar.




Clicking on this button will open the settings panel. All settings are editable by the user. Once settings are updated, an event is sent to the Chainlit server so the application can react to the update.
