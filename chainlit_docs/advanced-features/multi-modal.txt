Advanced Features
Multi-Modality
The term ‘Multi-Modal’ refers to the ability to support more than just text, encompassing images, videos, audio and files.

Voice Assistant


Chainlit let’s you access the user’s microphone audio stream and process it in real-time. This can be used to create voice assistants, transcribe audio, or even process audio in real-time.


The user will only be able to use the microphone if you implemented the

@cl.on_audio_chunk
 decorator.

Spontaneous File Uploads


Within the Chainlit application, users have the flexibility to attach any file to their messages. This can be achieved either by utilizing the drag and drop feature or by clicking on the 
attach
 button located in the chat bar.


Attach files to a message


As a developer, you have the capability to access these attached files through the 
cl.on_message
 decorated function.


import
 chainlit 
as
 cl






@cl
.
on_message


async
 
def
 
on_message
(
msg
:
 cl
.

)
:


    
if
 
not

.
elements
:

 cl
.

(

=
"No file attached"
)

Disabling Spontaneous File Uploads


If you wish to disable this feature (which would prevent users from attaching files to their messages), you can do so by setting 
features.spontaneous_file_upload.enabled=false
 in your Chainlit

 file.
