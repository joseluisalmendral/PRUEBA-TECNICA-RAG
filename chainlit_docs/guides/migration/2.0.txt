​
Updating Chainlit


Begin the migration by updating Chainlit to the latest version:


pip 
install
 
--upgrade
 chainlit




​
What changes?


The Chainlit UI (including the copilot) has been completely re-written with Shadcn/Tailwind. This brings several advantages:




The codebase is simpler and more contribution friendly.


It enabled the new custom element feature.


The theme customisation is more powerful.




Full changelog available 
here
.


​
How to migrate?


​
1. Regenerate the config file


The following fields have been removed from the 
config.toml
 file:




follow_symlink
: Chainlit no longer uses 
StaticFiles
 to serve files.


font_family
, 
custom_font
, 
[UI.theme]
: Theme customisation now uses a 
separate file
.


audio
: Chainlit audio streaming has been rework to match the 
realtime APIs
.




You can either manually remove those field or remove the 
.chainlit/config.toml
 file and restart your application.


​
2. Cookie Auth & Cross Origins


All of the authentication mechanisms now use cookie auth instead of directly using a JWT. This change makes Chainlit more secure.


This does not require any change in your app code. However, this implies that Chainlit is now more picky about cross origins (for instance when using a copilot on a website).


If you need to consume a Chainlit app on a different origin, make sure you allow it in the 
config.toml
 under 
allow_origins
.


​
3. Actions




The 
value
 field has replaced with 
payload
 which accepts a Python dict. This makes actions more useful.


The 
description
 field has been renamed 
tooltip
.


The field 
icon
 has been added. You can use any lucide icon name.


The 
collapsed
 field has been removed.




​
4. Copilot Widget Config




The 
fontFamily
 field has been removed. Check the 
new custom theme documentation
.


the 
button.style
 field has been replaced with 
button.className
. You can use any tailwind class to style the widget button.
