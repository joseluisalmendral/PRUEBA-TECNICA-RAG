Life Cycle Hooks
on_chat_resume
Decorator to enable users to continue a conversation.
Requires both 
data persistence
 and 
authentication
 to be enabled.


This decorator will automatically:




Send the persisted messages and elements to the UI.


Restore the user session.




Only JSON serializable fields of the user session will be saved and restored.


​
Usage


At minimum, you will need to use the 
@cl.on_chat_resume
 decorator to resume conversations.


@cl
.
on_chat_resume


async
 
def
 
on_chat_resume
(
thread
)
:


    
pass




However, if you are using a Langchain agent for instance, you will need to reinstantiate and set it in the user session yourself.
