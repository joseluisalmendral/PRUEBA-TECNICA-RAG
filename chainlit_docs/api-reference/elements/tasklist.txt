Elements
TaskList
The 
TaskList
 class allows you to display a task list next to the chatbot UI.


​
Attributes


​
status
str
The status of the TaskList. We suggest using something short like “Ready”,
“Running…”, “Failed”, “Done”.


​
tasks
Task
The list of tasks to be displayed in the UI.


​
Usage


The TaskList element is slightly different from other elements in that it is not attached to a Message or Step but can be sent directly to the chat interface.
